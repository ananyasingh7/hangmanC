# hangmanC
Created Hangman in C 

I recieved last semesters CS288 assignments and decided to get a headstart :)

update 1/6/2019
-Finished like 65 percent of it
-I think my problem is I don't full understand pointers and addresses in C, need to work on tommorow

update 1/7/2019
-finished the game, need to work on designing it but thats easy. 
-my problem wasn't pointers or addresses, I was looking at my code the wrong way.
